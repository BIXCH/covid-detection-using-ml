# COVID-19 Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect **COVID-19** from chest X-ray images. The model is trained using deep learning techniques and can classify whether a given X-ray image belongs to a **COVID-19 positive** or **normal (healthy)** patient.

## Features
- Uses **CNN** for feature extraction and classification.
- Trained on a dataset of **COVID-19** and **normal X-ray images**.
- Implements **image augmentation** for better generalization.
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting COVID-19 cases.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two classes:
1. **COVID-19 X-ray images**
2. **Normal (Healthy) X-ray images**

Ensure you have a dataset structured as follows:
```
Covid19-dataset/
    train/
        Covid/
        Normal/
    test/
        Covid/
        Normal/
```

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib keras
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction
- **MaxPooling Layers** to reduce spatial dimensions
- **Flattening** to convert 2D features into a 1D vector
- **Dense Layers** for classification

## Training the Model
Run the following script to train the model:
```python
python train.py
```
This will:
- Load the dataset
- Preprocess images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Train the CNN model
- Save the trained model for future inference

## Testing and Prediction
To test an image for COVID detection, run:
```python
python predict.py --image path/to/xray.jpg

this could be wrong you have to try yourself
```

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Future Improvements
- Increase dataset size for better generalization.
- Implement transfer learning with pretrained models like **ResNet**.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
